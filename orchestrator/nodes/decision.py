"""
Decision node:
- Uses the same LLM call pattern as planner.py (sync adapter: llm.plan(...)).
- If LLM is absent or fails, falls back to a deterministic policy.
- Writes 'next' so the graph can route via _next_route(state).
- Ensures an executable action exists when route='executor':
  * Insert a normalized {"step":"proposed_action", ...} at the start of the plan.
  * Also set 'proposed_action' at top-level state for the executor.
  * Additionally expose 'action' and 'payload' (extra compatibility).
